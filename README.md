## 🛟 What is the Piscine?

The *Piscine* (French for "swimming pool") is a teaching method developed by the French engineering school EPITA in the 1980s. It consists of a period of several days dedicated to intensive, group-based learning of a programming language. The goal is to learn as much as possible in a limited time, while strengthening group cohesion and providing a unique experience.

The term most likely comes from the expression "to be thrown into the deep end" (*sauter dans le grand bain*). The idea is to drop students into a difficult environment with no prior instruction, to see who learns to "swim" (code/survive) and who "drowns" (ragequits).

At 42 School, the Piscine is the final step of the admissions process before acceptance. It takes the form of a one-month-long bootcamp, seven days a week, dedicated to solving problems in the C programming language (with a bit of shell scripting during the first two days). There are no teachers, lectures, or courses; everything relies entirely on peer learning. Exercises are first assessed by other "Pisciners", then graded by a series of unit tests known as the dreaded *Moulinette*.
